# Pokemon Flip!
## Project Description
8 preset Pokemon will load onto the page in sets of 2 to cover all 16 squares. The user will flip each square and try to match the sets until all the matches are done meaning the game is over.

## User Stories
### MVP
- As a player, I want my game to realize when two of the images match up.

- As a player, I would like for the images to flip into the Pokemon.

- As a player, I would like for the image to flip back over if it's not a match.

- As a player, I would like for images to be in random spaces each time
